You are to write an application that is kind of like Craigslist, but for jobs only. It will allow a user to post a job that someone needs, and everyone else has the ability to see all the jobs that have been posted. . 

Features/Functionalities:

The home page shall display a list of all jobs
Users shall sign up using a registration page
Users shall be logged in to create a post or edit a job
Users shall be permitted to edit (update and delete) only their own jobs.
Every page (or template) should have a link (or button) to add a new job. This link shall be visible only when the user is logged in
There shall be a link to Logout which, when clicked, logs out the user and redirects them to the login page. This link shall only be visible when the user is logged in.
Implement Bootstrap to make the site look good
Use a  database to store your jobs 
Pre-loading data is recommended but not required. You probably want to modify the data loader to execute only once.
Display the logged in username on every page (or in the navigation menu) where they are logged in.
If you don't know how to make a particular feature work then skip it and get the rest of the application working and uploaded in GitHub. Then go back and add the missing feature(s) - one at a time.

Test your application often and put it in GitHub often so you always have a working version on which to add the next feature.
